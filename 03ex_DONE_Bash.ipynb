    "### 5. **Creating Files Based on Groups**\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to group students by their position in the file and create separate files for each group. In your case, the goal was to group students by their position modulo 18. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Group 1: lines 1, 19, 37, 55, …\n",
    "- Group 2: lines 2, 20, 38, 56, …\n",
    "- Group 3: lines 3, 21, 39, 57, …\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down the commands used for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.1 **The `awk` Command**\n",
    "\n",
    "`awk` is a powerful text processing tool, commonly used for pattern scanning and processing. The basic syntax of `awk` looks like this:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "awk 'pattern { action }' input_file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`NR`**: `NR` stands for **Number of Records**. It represents the current line number of the input file being processed. So, if you're processing the first line of a file, `NR` is 1, for the second line it’s 2, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`%`**: The modulo operator (`%`) calculates the remainder when one number is divided by another. In this case, we use it to group lines based on their line number. For example, `NR % 18 == 1` checks if the current line number (`NR`) is divisible by 18 with a remainder of 1 (i.e., 1, 19, 37, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.2 **Example with `awk`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how we can use `awk` to group lines in the file based on their modulo 18 position:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "awk 'NR % 18 == 1' students_list.csv > group_1.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `NR % 18 == 1`: This condition selects lines whose line number divided by 18 has a remainder of 1 (i.e., 1st, 19th, 37th, etc.).\n",
    "- `students_list.csv`: The input file.\n",
    "- `> group_1.txt`: The output redirection operator `>` writes the selected lines into `group_1.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to group all 18 groups, you could use a loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "for i in {1..18}; do awk \"NR % 18 == $i\" students_list.csv > \"group_$i.txt\"; done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{1..18}`: This generates numbers from 1 to 18.\n",
    "- `awk \"NR % 18 == $i\"`: For each iteration, `$i` is replaced by the group number (1 through 18).\n",
    "- `\"group_$i.txt\"`: The output file is named `group_1.txt`, `group_2.txt`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will split the original `students_list.csv` into 18 separate files, each containing students whose line number is congruent to the respective group number modulo 18.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Miscellaneous Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section covers some basic file operations using `test` and other commands to check properties of files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1 **Check if a File is a Directory**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if something is a directory using the `test` command with the `-d` flag. The syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "test -d directory_name && echo \"It is a directory\" || echo \"It is not a directory\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `test -d directory_name`: Checks if `directory_name` exists and is a directory.\n",
    "- `&&`: If the previous command (`test`) is true (i.e., it’s a directory), the command after `&&` is executed.\n",
    "- `||`: If the previous command (`test`) is false (i.e., it’s not a directory), the command after `||` is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this command will print:\n",
    "- `\"It is a directory\"` if the path points to a directory.\n",
    "- `\"It is not a directory\"` if it’s not a directory (e.g., it’s a file or doesn't exist).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.2 **Check if a File Exists**\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if a file exists, use `test -f`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "test -f filename && echo \"File exists\" || echo \"File does not exist\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `test -f filename`: Checks if the file `filename` exists and is a regular file (not a directory or special file).\n",
    "- The rest works the same way as in the previous example: it echoes a message depending on whether the file exists or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of points 5 and 6\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **`NR`**: Represents the current line number when processing a file.\n",
    "- **Modulo (`%`)**: The remainder when dividing one number by another. It's used here to group lines based on their line number.\n",
    "- **`awk`**: A powerful text-processing tool that allows pattern-based processing. You can use it to filter, transform, or format data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commands:\n",
    "- **`awk 'NR % 18 == n'`**: Filters lines where the line number modulo 18 is equal to `n`. This is used to create groups.\n",
    "- **`test -d`**: Tests if a directory exists.\n",
    "- **`test -f`**: Tests if a file exists.\n",

    "grep -o '\\b[0-9]*[02468]\\b' filename | wc -l\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breakdown:\n",
    "- **`grep -o`**: The `-o` option tells `grep` to output only the matching part of the line. Without `-o`, `grep` would return the entire line, but you only want the matching numbers.\n",
    "- **`'\\b[0-9]*[02468]\\b'`**: This is the regular expression used to match even numbers:\n",
    "  - `\\b`: Word boundary. This ensures that the numbers are distinct and not part of a longer string of digits (for example, `123` won't match `12` in `12345`).\n",
    "  - `[0-9]*`: Matches any number of digits (0 or more digits).\n",
    "  - `[02468]`: This matches any of the digits `0`, `2`, `4`, `6`, or `8` at the end of the number, ensuring it's even.\n",
    "  - `\\b`: Word boundary to end the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`wc -l`**: This counts the number of lines produced by `grep`, effectively counting the number of even numbers found.\n",

    "- **`if($i % 2 == 0)`**: This checks if the \\( i \\)-th field (number) is divisible by 2 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is 0). This identifies even numbers.\n",
    "- **`count++`**: If the condition is true, it increments the `count` variable by 1.\n",
